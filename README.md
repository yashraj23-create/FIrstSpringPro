TripMate CRUD Backend
ðŸ“Œ Overview

TripMate is a simple CRUD-based backend application built with Spring Boot that allows users to manage trip-related information.
This version focuses on trip creation, retrieval, and deletion â€” updating trips is intentionally excluded, as real trips canâ€™t be altered once completed.

ðŸš€ Features

Create a new trip record

Retrieve all trips or a specific trip by ID

Delete a trip by ID

No update functionality (design choice)

Built using Spring Boot, JPA, and MySQL
